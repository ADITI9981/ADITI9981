# 👋 Hi, I'm Aditi Yadav! 🌟

Data Science enthusiast | Passionate about AI | Learner for Life

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about solving real-world problems using Data
Science and AI. I'm currently a BTech student in Information Technology at Acropolis
Institute of Technology, working towards becoming a Data Scientist. I love exploring
algorithms, deep learning, and AI deployment.

🌌 I believe that the world of data is like the cosmos – full of mysteries waiting to be 
discovered! And I'm here to uncover them, one algorithm at a time.




## 🚀 About Me
I am on a journey to build impactful AI projects and solve complex problems.

I believe in continuous learning and pushing my limits in Data Structures, Machine 
Learning, Deep Learning, and AI.

I enjoy exploring the cosmos and understanding the mysteries of the universe 
alongside my tech ventures. 🌌
